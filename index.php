/*
 * BitBucket Commit Message to Trello Card Comments
 * @author Andrew Natoli
 *
 * Put this on your server and create a "push" webhook for it on BitBucket. When you push a commit containing the
 * full URL of a Trello card you can comment on, the commit message, URL, and author will be posted as a comment on
 * that card.
 *
 * Remember to copy config-example.php to config.php and populate the values with your own application keys.
 *
 * This was built for a specific use case. If you wish to extend any functionality of this program whether it
 * be improving the comment messages, enhancing security, etc. please fork the repo and submit a pull request!
